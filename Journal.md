**June 12**

- Finalized the idea.
- Created Repo, and tried to add the repo in submission.yml but failed, i guess it is because i did'nt had journal.md .
- I will first complete the research for parts, then i will start building the PCB. 
- Finalized the Features and the Parts, Next step is working on PCB.

- Learning more CAD
- Can't find Symbols and Footprints for the blutooth module.
- Changed some plan and removed RTL-SDR and radio option for V1.
- Tired can't find all the footprints, it will be more complex creating whole footprint...
- Finally fixed and almost completed schematics
- Well it is 13 now technically but I haven't slept so for me it is still same.
- already started working on the CAD, completed bottom portion paused the pcb part because I got bored doing that, well currently I'm not doing anything just went to bed and writing this journal on phone, I'll add the image of the bottom tomorrow, byee:)
