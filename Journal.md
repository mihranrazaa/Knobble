**June 12**

- Finalized the idea.
- Created Repo, and tried to add the repo in submission.yml but failed, i guess it is because i did'nt had journal.md .
- I will first complete the research for parts, then i will start building the PCB. 
- Finalized the Features and the Parts, Next step is working on PCB.

- Learning more CAD
- Can't find Symbols and Footprints for the blutooth module.
- Changed some plan and removed RTL-SDR and radio option for V1.
- Tired can't find all the footprints, it will be more complex creating whole footprint...
- Finally fixed and almost completed schematics
- Well it is 13 now technically but I haven't slept so for me it is still same.
- already started working on the CAD, completed bottom portion paused the pcb part because I got bored doing that, well currently I'm not doing anything just went to bed and writing this journal on phone, I'll add the image of the bottom tomorrow, byee:)

- ALRIGHT so this will be my final project for highway, and at last I have finalized what this project will be doing, a rtl sdr and rpi based radio, which will not only play conventional fm radio but it can also listen airplanes, emergency radios and other amateur radios, there will be 4 buttons with an oled display and rotary encoder which will be the front end of this project why rpi like no zero, my plan is improving it to become a radiodeck for pentesting and ham radio so it is better to choose a good long term component and rtl sdr is the right and only choice for this project in budget
- first I will start by schematics ofc I will make one pcb for the all the components except sdr and rpi and those will fit like a hat and the 3d case for enclosure
- even tho I haven't gotten approval in any of the other two projects of mine I'll try once more to build something ngl I'm feeling a bit hopeless now going to undercity
