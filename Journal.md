- Finalized the idea.
- Created Repo, and tried to add the repo in submission.yml but failed, i guess it is because i did'nt had journal.md .
- I will first complete the research for parts, then i will start building the PCB. 
- Finalized the Features and the Parts, Next step is working on PCB.

- Learning more CAD
- Can't find Symbols and Footprints for the blutooth module.
- Changed some plan and removed RTL-SDR and radio option for V1.
- Tired can't find all the footprints, it will be more complex creating whole footprint...
